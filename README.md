OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
   Rainfall forecasting is very important because heavy and irregular rainfall can 
have many impacts like destruction of crops and farms, damage of property so a better 
forecasting model is essential for an early warning that can minimize risks to life and 
property and also managing the agricultural farms in better way. This prediction mainly 
helps farmers and also water resources can be utilized efficiently. Rainfall prediction is a 
challenging task and the results should be accurate. Rainfall prediction is one of the most 
important and challenging tasks in the modern world. In general, climate and rainfall are highly 
non-linear and complicated phenomena, which require advanced computer modelling and 
simulation for their accurate prediction. To quickly discover and analyse complex patterns and 
requirements, need the efficient techniques and need to learn from new data which will be 
necessary for information-intensive applications rainfall prediction has become very 
complicated in recent times due to climate change and variability. The efficiency of classification 
algorithms in rainfall prediction has flourished. The study contributes to using various 
classification algorithms for rainfall prediction in the different ecological zones of Australia. The 
classification algorithms include Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF),Logistic Regression(LR).
The estimation of rainfall is of great importance in terms ofwater resources management, 
human life and theirenvironment. It can be met with the incorrect or incomplete estimation 
problems because rainfall estimation is affectedfrom the geographical and regional changes and 
properties. This project contains different methods used for rainfall prediction.

OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
 
  The main objective of our thesis are,
 The objective of this work is to carry out an exploratory analysis on the 
use of machine learning algorithms to model the phenomenon of rain
 I have taken a dataset of precipitation measurements and atmospheric 
conditions in Australia and it can able to find the best model since I use 
more models 
 finally I will display all the accuracy % using data visualization in 
graphs,blot,heatmap etc..
